# File-Reading-and-Writing
It's a C Program that will get two filenames as command line arguments. Opens file #1 for reading and appends the contents of file #1 to file #2.If file #1 doesn't exist it gives a proper error message and if file #2 doesn't exist it creates a new one. After appending it deletes file #1.

The Code exist in read_wrire.c.

Any files can be used as source and destination but in my case I use source.txt and destination.txt.

backup folder contains the same files(source.txt and destination.txt) just in case of running the program again as the source.txt will be deleted.
